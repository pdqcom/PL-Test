You will need to replace the KBNumber in the PARAMETERS field of STEP 1 with the KBNumber you wish to deploy.\n2. Make sure you preserve the exact syntax as shown.\n3. The KB will only install if it applies to the operating system.\n\nName: PSWindowsUpdate (WSUS Alternative)\nPublisher: PowerShellGallery\nHome: https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWindowsUpdate/2.2.1.4\nDownload: https://psg-prod-eastus.azureedge.net/packages/pswindowsupdate.2.2.1.4.nupkg\nSupported Operating Systems: Windows 10, 11, Server 2016, 2019, 2022\nSupported Architecture: 32/64 bit\nKB Article: https://help.pdq.com/hc/en-us/articles/13615858339611\n\nWhile we typically avoid third-party tools, the PSWindowsUpdate module is well-known and widely used for checking and applying all available Microsoft updates to a machine and can be a viable alternative to WSUS. If you are a military or government organization, you may want to review this PowerShell Module in greater detail before placing into production to ensure that it meets your security standards.\n\n1. Check if the NuGet Package Provider is installed. If it is not, it will attempt to download and install the Nuget Provider.\n2. Check if the PSWindowsUpdate module is installed. If it is not, it will use the NuGet installer to attempt to download and install the PSWindowsUpdate module.\n3. It will then check for any existing WSUS/Windows Update registry settings and back them up before removing them. (This is to avoid returning a partial list of available updates restricted by policies)\n4. It will then run the PSWindowsUpdate module and check for all available Microsoft patches.\n5. Then, depending on which of the 6 packages you've selected to run, it will install those updates.\n6. Reboots are disabled, but may be required in order to complete the installation of some patches and properly reflect that packages have been successfully installed\n7. Finally, it will look and if the registry did have existing WSUS/Windows update policies, it will restore those settings to honor the organization GPO/configuration.\n\n*If the PowerShell script fails, the target computer may need you to run an additional command first to allow PowerShell scripts to run. You can create a custom package with a PowerShell step and paste this code in the PowerShell step:\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force\n*This package will not work on air-gapped networks"

This only installs the 32-bit version of Adobe Reader DC.  At this time we only provide a 32-bit installation for Adobe Reader DC due to complications with the unified 64-bit installer for Adobe Acrobat/Adobe Reader. Both installations for Adobe Acrobat DC 64-bit and Adobe Reader DC 64-bit are indistinguishable and this leads to a problem with identifying the applications with current collections as well as the potential for overwriting an older licensed version of Adobe Acrobat with the latest unlicensed (free) version Adobe Reader 64-bit.\nhttps://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/DesktopDeployment/singleinstaller.html\n2. Target computers MUST have older version of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC MUI (Continuous Track)\n3. If you recieve an error that the update does not apply, you may have the older Adobe Reader (Classic) version installed. If this is the case,\nyou'll want to run the full package Adober Reader DC (32-bit) to update to the latest Continuous (MUI) version. This patch will then work going forward.\n4. Disables Auto Update, Adobe Upselling and Adobe Services.\n5. Versions 15.023.20053 and higher come with the Adobe Acrobat extension for Chrome that are disabled in steps 8 and 9."
