You will need to replace the KBNumber in the PARAMETERS field of STEP 1 with the KBNumber you wish to deploy.\n2. Make sure you preserve the exact syntax as shown.\n3. The KB will only install if it applies to the operating system.\n\nName: PSWindowsUpdate (WSUS Alternative)\nPublisher: PowerShellGallery\nHome: https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWindowsUpdate/2.2.1.4\nDownload: https://psg-prod-eastus.azureedge.net/packages/pswindowsupdate.2.2.1.4.nupkg\nSupported Operating Systems: Windows 10, 11, Server 2016, 2019, 2022\nSupported Architecture: 32/64 bit\nKB Article: https://help.pdq.com/hc/en-us/articles/13615858339611\n\nWhile we typically avoid third-party tools, the PSWindowsUpdate module is well-known and widely used for checking and applying all available Microsoft updates to a machine and can be a viable alternative to WSUS. If you are a military or government organization, you may want to review this PowerShell Module in greater detail before placing into production to ensure that it meets your security standards.\n\n1. Check if the NuGet Package Provider is installed. If it is not, it will attempt to download and install the Nuget Provider.\n2. Check if the PSWindowsUpdate module is installed. If it is not, it will use the NuGet installer to attempt to download and install the PSWindowsUpdate module.\n3. It will then check for any existing WSUS/Windows Update registry settings and back them up before removing them. (This is to avoid returning a partial list of available updates restricted by policies)\n4. It will then run the PSWindowsUpdate module and check for all available Microsoft patches.\n5. Then, depending on which of the 6 packages you've selected to run, it will install those updates.\n6. Reboots are disabled, but may be required in order to complete the installation of some patches and properly reflect that packages have been successfully installed\n7. Finally, it will look and if the registry did have existing WSUS/Windows update policies, it will restore those settings to honor the organization GPO/configuration.\n\n*If the PowerShell script fails, the target computer may need you to run an additional command first to allow PowerShell scripts to run. You can create a custom package with a PowerShell step and paste this code in the PowerShell step:\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force\n*This package will not work on air-gapped networks"

If there are, the package will fail and the target machine will need to be rebooted. Without this the DWG installer will reboot the target machine and fail to install.\n5. This will not upgrade or uninstall previous versions of Autodesk DWG TrueView.\n6. This deployment will cause approximately 1.0 GB of data to cross your network per target.

The KB will only install if it applies to the operating system.\n\nName: PSWindowsUpdate (WSUS Alternative)\nPublisher: PowerShellGallery\nHome: https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWindowsUpdate/2.2.0.3\nDownload: https://psg-prod-eastus.azureedge.net/packages/pswindowsupdate.2.2.0.3.nupkg\nVirusTotal: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/29b510ec19c8c8796ecf762f11a852143878c64ca76c7606764df428677a9d0a\nSupported Operating Systems: Windows 10, 11, Server 2016, 2019, 2022\nSupported Architecture: 32/64 bit\nKB Article: https://adminarsenal.zendesk.com/knowledge/articles/13615858339611\n\nWhile we typically avoid third-party tools, the PSWindowsUpdate module is well-known and widely used for checking and applying all available Microsoft updates to a machine and can be a viable alternative to WSUS. If you are a military or government organization, you may want to review this PowerShell Module in greater detail before placing into production to ensure that it meets your security standards.\n\n1. This package will download the NuGet Installer\n2. Install the third-party PowerShell module: PSWindowsUpdate\n3. Run the module and install Microsoft Updates\n4. A reboot may be required to complete installation\n\n*If the PowerShell script fails, the target computer may need you to run an additional command first to allow PowerShell scripts to run. You can create a custom package with a PowerShell step and paste this code in the PowerShell step:\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force\n*This package will not work on air-gapped networks"
