This only installs the 32-bit version of Adobe Reader DC.  At this time we only provide a 32-bit installation for Adobe Reader DC due to complications with the unified 64-bit installer for Adobe Acrobat/Adobe Reader. Both installations for Adobe Acrobat DC 64-bit and Adobe Reader DC 64-bit are indistinguishable and this leads to a problem with identifying the applications with current collections as well as the potential for overwriting an older licensed version of Adobe Acrobat with the latest unlicensed (free) version Adobe Reader 64-bit.<br>https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/DesktopDeployment/singleinstaller.html<br>2. Target computers MUST have older version of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC MUI (Continuous Track)<br>3. If you recieve an error that the update does not apply, you may have the older Adobe Reader (Classic) version installed. If this is the case,<br>you'll want to run the full package Adober Reader DC (32-bit) to update to the latest Continuous (MUI) version. This patch will then work going forward.<br>4.

This will not upgrade or uninstall previous versions of Autodesk DWG TrueView.<br>6. This deployment will cause approximately 1.0 GB of data to cross your network per target. This deployment may take a long time to complete. The default timeout has been increased to two hours.
